# GameEngine
This game engine has been created without any other existing game engine. It uses Tkinter to generate a graphic interface, Pynput to bind keyboard inputs and Threading to allow multitasking.

# Starting
Start the game with the simple command 'python3 game.py'

# Actions : 

arrows to move
[space] to build

[backspace] to break

[1] / [2] to change the building block (water/brick)

[ctrl] to save your builds

[ctrl + return] to load your saved world.

Enjoy !  
ps this is not the simplest minecraft in 2d :)
